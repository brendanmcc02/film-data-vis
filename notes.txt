js can be run in 1 of 2 environments:

1. nodeJS
2. web browser

in nodeJS, read/write of files is easy.
however, in the web browser, it is not basically
not possible to write files on the fly for security reasons.

My idea is to run updateDB.js in nodeJS regularly (once/twice 24 hours).
The website will (naturally) run js in a web environment,
and it only needs to read the file.

updateDB.JS is responsible for writing updates to the file.
