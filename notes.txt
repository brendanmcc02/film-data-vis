initialising db must be done in 5+ increments
why? api is limited to 100 requests/24hrs

assume we have a full db, how to maintain it?

cron job (runs once every 24 hours)

web scrape just first page of my ratings (if I rate over 100 films in 24 hours then it breaks)
(but this is exceptionally unlikely to happen)

for each of these 100 films:
- if film is already in db:
    update myRating, watchedInCinema
- else:
    append film to db using the api

create a webscraper function that for each film:
- gets number of votes
- gets imdb rating

iterate through db and update imdbRating and numberOfVotes




## Graphs I'm interested in:

1. Mean Genre Rating
2. Top 5/10 Directors (>= 5 films)
3. Ratings of directors' films (Nolan, Villeneuve, etc.) Line chart
4. My Rating of IMDB Top 25
5. IMDB's rating of my Top 25
6. Mean Decade Rating
5. Mean Rating per year (Line chart)
6. Mean Runtime Rating (<90, <120, ..., <210, <240)
7. Quantity of films watched per runtime interval (Piechart)
8. Quantity of films watched per genre (Piechart)
9. numOfVotes vs. Mean Rating (Scatterplot)
10. Ratings of franchises (Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel) Line chart

## Challenging Graph ideas
1. English-spoken films vs foreign films
   a. Mean Rating (Bar chart)
   b. Proportion (Pie chart)
2. Top 5/10 Actors (>= 5 films)
3.
5. Rating
