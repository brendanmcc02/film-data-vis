initialising db must be done in 5+ increments
why? api is limited to 100 requests/24hrs

assume we have a full db, how to maintain it?

cron job (runs once every 24 hours)

web scrape just first page of my ratings (if I rate over 100 films in 24 hours then it breaks)
(but this is exceptionally unlikely to happen)

for each of these 100 films:
- if film is already in db:
    update myRating, watchedInCinema
- else:
    append film to db using the api

create a webscraper function that for each film:
- gets number of votes
- gets imdb rating

iterate through db and update imdbRating and numberOfVotes
