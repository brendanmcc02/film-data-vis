                Nothing incredibly striking or surprising about this graph if I'm honest. It is interesting to see War
                being ranked as my clear number one. It's impressive to see Drama with a very high rating given that it
                is my most watched genre (see next graph).
                <br>
                <br>
                I expected Horror to be one of the lowest ranked. Yes, there are good horror films out there, but for
                the most part it is a cheap and awful genre. Not surprised by that at all. Musical being my lowest sort
                of surprises me, but not really in all honesty. I have watched a decent amount of musicals from the 60s
                and I wasn't too impressed by them.

                Similarly, nothing too surprising here. Drama of course takes the number 1 spot; the vast majority of
                films are classed as a Drama.
                <br>
                <br>
                A lot more comedy films than I was expecting, but they are all definitely not solely Comedy films, they
                are probably also Family or Animated films that get classed as Comedies (films can have more than one type
                of genre associated with it).

                Definitely some surprises here. Before seeing this graph, my 3 favourite directors have always been
                Nolan, Chazelle, Villeneuve. Nice to see them here.
                <br>
                <br>
                Linklater has also been a favourite of mine, so wasn't surprised to see him here. The reason his rating
                is so high is the Before Trilogy is highly rating by me Respectively I gave the 3 films a 10,
                9, and a 9. I also gave Boyhood a 9, but School of Rock brings it down with a 7.
                <br>
                <br>
                Very surprised to see Unkrich here. The reason why he is here is he directed many of the Pixar Films.
                So it's not necessarily that I love Unkrich as a director, more so that he
                happened to direct a lot of my favourite Pixar Films (Coco, Toy Story 2 & 3, Finding Nemo,
                Monsters Inc.).

                My all-time favourite director. Seeing this graph now really emphasises how impressive it is that I
                love so many of his films. We can kind of see a pattern where his earlier filmography floats between
                9's and 7's, then peaks at The Dark Knight and Inception, then levels out at 9's and 8's.

              <br>
              This graph is unexpectedly interesting - it's very 'boring', but that itself is fascinating given that I
              have given all 6 of a Director's films an 8. I'm writing this before Dune Part 2 comes out so this may

              Okay here is an interesting one. Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy, and Michael Caine are all up there

              director, and has a high mean rating.

              <br>
              Viggo Mortensen has 3 Lord of the Ring films (which I have given all a 9), Captain Fantastic which I gave

              <br>
              Wallace Shawn voices in 6 Pixar Films, and as we have already seen, those are highly rated.
              He then features in Marriage Story, which is a film I loved (it got a 9).

              Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
