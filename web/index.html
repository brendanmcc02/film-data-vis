            Nothing incredibly striking or surprising about this graph if I'm honest. It is interesting to see War
            being ranked as my (as of writing this) clear number one. It's impressive to see Drama with a very high
            rating given that it is my most watched genre (see next graph).
            <br>
            <br>
            I expected Horror to be one of the lowest ranked. Yes, there are good horror films out there, but for
            the most part it is a cheap and awful genre. Not surprised by that at all. Musical being my lowest sort
            of surprises me, but not really in all honesty. I have watched a decent amount of musicals from the 60s,
            and I wasn't too impressed by them.

            <br>
            A lot more comedy films than I was expecting, but they are all definitely not solely Comedy films, they
            are probably also Family or Animated films that get classed as Comedies (films can have more than one type

            Definitely some surprises here. Before seeing this graph, my three favourite directors have always been
            Nolan, Chazelle, Villeneuve. Nice to see them here.
            <br>
            <br>
            Linklater has also been a favourite of mine, so wasn't surprised to see him here. The reason his rating
            is so high is the Before Trilogy is highly rating by me Respectively I gave the three films a 10,
            9, and a 9. I also gave Boyhood a 9, but School of Rock brings it down with a 7.
            <br>
            <br>
            Very surprised to see Unkrich here. The reason why he is here is he directed many of the Pixar Films.
            So it's not necessarily that I love Unkrich as a director, more so that he
            happened to direct a lot of my favourite Pixar Films (Coco, Toy Story 2 & 3, Finding Nemo,
            Monsters Inc.).

            This graph is unexpectedly interesting - it's very 'boring', but that itself is fascinating given that I

            Okay here is an interesting one. Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy, and Michael Caine are all up there
            because they are all frequent collaborators with Nolan, who as we have already seen is my favourite
            director, and has a high mean rating.
            <br>
            <br>
            Wallace Shawn voices in 6 Pixar Films, and as we have already seen, those are highly rated.
            He then features in Marriage Story, which is a film I loved (it got a 9).
            <br>
            <br>
            Ethan Hawke is there because he is in four of my highly rated Linklater films (Before Trilogy & Boyhood).
            First Reformed and Dead Poets Society were given an 8. The mean drops due to his appearance in Glass
            Onion - a film I wasn't fond of, receiving a 6.

        <h3 class="description description-subtitle">>= 10 Films</h3>
        <p class="description description-para">
            This graph needs a description. Data visualisation can tell stories and patterns, but it can often be
            misleading if context is not known. Obviously I did my best to filter out the extreme cases by only
            featuring decades with >= 10 films - for example, 1930 only has 3 films, so it can be skewed. However,
            you can't manipulate data too much to get the results you want.
            <br>
            <br>
            In fairness, I thought films before the 70s and 80s would be much higher. If there is a film from the 2020s
            that has let's say a 7.0 IMDB rating and 65 metascore, I (and many others I would argue) would be much less
            likely to watch that film if it was made in the 60s or 70s. We'll see this later with the cinema graphs, but
            I will sometimes watch modern films that I know are poor, but watch it anyway for social reasons or if
            people are going to watch it in the cinema. Another reason is survivorship bias - an old, average film is
            less likely going to be watched by modern audiences because it gets lost in time. So, most older films are
            watched because they stood the test of time, the fact that they are remembered to this day is a testament to
            their quality or cultural impact.
            <br>
            <br>
            These are things I have thought before seeing this graph, so in all honesty I thought the older films would
            have higher ratings. I think this is also because there are quite a few films deemed as 'classics' or 'must
            watches', but then I watch them and am not impressed. I'd say that balances it out.
            <br>
            <br>
            It's eye-catching as well to see 2020 being the lowest. I would say it's because I started watching more
            'bad' films either in cinema or for social reasons, like I mentioned before.

            In concept, I thought this graph could yield eye-opening results, but not really in all honest. However,
            like we saw with the Villeneuve film graph, 'boring' graphs can still have their own insights. The
            takeaway from this is that there is no clear correlation between film runtime and my liking of them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now obviously I'm not ignorant to the clear lead of <3h and <3h30m, but I would argue that this is mainly
            for one reason: if a film has a very long runtime, and the reviews are average, I am much less likely to
            watch the longer film, as opposed to a film with let's say a normal 2hr runtime. This creates a bias for
            the longer films, hence the higher mean rating.

            Following the Academy Award definition of an International Film: The Film is produced outside the USA
            and has a >50% non-English dialogue track. So, I check if a film is produced outside the US (and the UK
            because realistically if a film is produced in the UK it will obviously have English be primarily spoken),
            and then I check if the first language in the film's language list is English. Unfortunately it's not
            perfect because, for example, Roma and All Quiet on the Western Front are international films, but because
            they are Netflix films, USA is included in its list of countries making it a non-international film.
            <br>
            <br>
            I expected International Films to have a higher mean, mostly because (similar reasoning as before) I am
            less likely to watch an average international film as opposed to an average American film. I think that
            is just a result of human nature: we tend towards the familiar.

            <br>
            I am quite surprised by this result. I guess the takeaway here is that there is no clear correlation

        <h2 class="description description-title">MEAN RATING OF FILMS WATCHED IN & OUT OF CINEMA</h2>
        <p class="description description-para">
            Okay this was very surprising. Before seeing this graph, rationally I expected the ratings of films
            watched in cinema to be higher - frankly because I am paying money for a ticket. Seeing a film at home is
            also much more convenient than going out to a cinema, and from memory there have been times when I have
            knowingly watched a film at home knowing the reviews were average, so I thought that would have brought
            the mean rating down.
            <br>
            <br>
            Surprise, surprise. The opposite is true. My rationale for this is that sometimes I will watch a film in
            cinema for social reasons, not because I think the film is good but just because others are going to see
            it. This would bring the rating down. Furthermore, sometimes I will be anticipating watching a film in
            cinema, for example from a director I like, so I will go in blind. The film may be a flop or poor, for
            example Babylon (dir. Damien Chazelle) or Napolean (dir. Ridley Scott). Still a surprising result.

        <h2 class="description description-title">MY RATING DISTRIBUTION</h2>
        <p class="description description-para">
            My standard for 10/10 films is very high. The best way to describe it is that I give it to films that I
            have experienced a special awe after watching them.
            <br>
            <br>
            It's natural to see a normal distribution emerging here - more interestingly however is that the vast
            majority of films are 6-8. There is a relatively big step from 5 to 6, and from 8 to 9. I would say this
            is because when rating films I can often be on the conservative side, for both good and bad films.
            <br>
            <br>
            Obviously there is going to be a skew towards the higher-rated films, because generally I make an effort
            to watch films that are well-rated, or that I think I will enjoy.
